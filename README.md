## D-separation
In order to use this repo to practice d-separation(before an exam), simply run the program and enter queries of the form 'X Y | Z',
where `X`, `Y` are two query nodes and `Z` is a set of observed nodes. This Repo assumes that we will be working with the bayesian network depicted below, this makes studying d-separation a lot faster, since creating a network can be quite time consuming. Furthermore, the network depicted is sufficiently complex to practice all posible situations that can occur your exam (forks, colliders, and chains). 

To run the code, try:
python dsep.py

Please note that additional, information will be printed by the repo at runtime.

A big thanks to lingxuez for creating most of the code that enabled me to make this study tool.
